  <h1>LeetCode Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
    <p>This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems covering various topics in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), along with theory sections explaining each topic.</p>

  <h2>Topics Covered</h2>

  <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. They provide constant-time access to elements using their indices. Arrays can be one-dimensional (vectors), two-dimensional (matrices), or multidimensional.</p>

  <h3>Linked Lists</h3>
    <p>Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be singly linked (each node points to the next node) or doubly linked (each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes).</p>

  <h3>Greedy Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are often used in optimization problems where finding the best solution requires considering multiple factors or constraints.</p>

  <h3>Recursion</h3>
    <p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is commonly used to solve problems with repeating substructures, such as tree traversal or factorial calculation.</p>

  <h3>Binary Search</h3>
    <p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.</p>
<h3>Heaps</h3>
<p>Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. In a max heap, each parent node is greater than or equal to its children, while in a min heap, each parent node is less than or equal to its children. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.</p>

<h3>Stacks</h3>
<p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push (add an element to the top of the stack) and pop (remove the top element from the stack).</p>

<h3>Queues</h3>
<p>A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: enqueue (add an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (remove the front element from the queue).</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>Strings are sequences of characters stored in contiguous memory locations. They support various operations such as concatenation, substring search, and pattern matching.</p>

<h3>Trees</h3>
<p>Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and each node can have zero or more child nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships and are the basis for many advanced data structures and algorithms.</p>

<h3>Graphs</h3>
<p>Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges that connect them. They can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges do not have a direction) and are used to model relationships between objects or entities.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Programming</h3>
<p>Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It is particularly useful for optimization problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.</p>
